# iPod Downloader #
This project is for educational use only. This software should not be used
for illegal copying of any multimedia content.

## Descrption ##
I wrote this program to earn some practice in windows desktop application development.
Idea of this project formed in my head since I found that Apple iPod 7 Nano contains his library data
in SQLite database. I didn't want to use any frameworks and done this program on clean Windows API.
It is very weird, when you need to download and install lots of frameworks megabytes for some simple small utility, which you will not use several times everyday.

## Purpose of this repository ##
I am beginning programmer and I publish this code for inspection only. I am grateful to my colleagues for experienced my code inspections and reviews of the project.

## Building ##
How to build this project? A piece of cake! Just open Downloader.sln in VisualStudio and run "Build solution".
